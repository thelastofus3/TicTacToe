# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game implemented in Java. Two players take turns to make their moves on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The game will start with an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (0 to 2) where they want to place their symbol.

## Game Rules

- Player X is human-controlled, and Player O is a bot.
- Enter row and column numbers (separated by a space) to make your move.
- The game ends when one player aligns three symbols or the grid is filled.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.

## Starting a New Round

- After each round, you can choose to start a new round or exit the game.

## Note

- The bot's moves are randomly generated.

## Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
